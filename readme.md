# YAJL 2 Compiled for Android#

YAJL is a portable JSON parsing and serialization library built in ANSI C.

For more information about the library in general and its usage, see the [main repository](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl).  

If you have Android specific issues, I can help, but issues not related to Android should be directed to the main repository as I am not an official maintainer.

### What makes this different from the main YAJL repo? ###

Makefile files have been premade by me for compiling YAJL on android for armeabi, armeabi-v7a, mips and x86. Also precompiled binaries are in the /libs directory.

Source wise, nothing so far and if I eventually had to change something, I would commit it back upstream if possible.
